This is a repository of synthdefs for the Oceanode framework. 

Oceanode uses the ofxSupercollider library to integrate communication with supercollider server, 
and it is capable of comunicating with synthdefs through custom graphic nodes.

This collection includes adaptations of "classic" synthdefs found on the internet, either at scccode.org and scsynth.org, github and online blogs,
as well as custom synths created by Playmodes. Feel free to re-use this codes for your own purposes!
